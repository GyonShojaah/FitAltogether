\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Future direct imaging observations of terrestrial exoplanets is expected to play a vital role in characterizing Earth analogs in habitable zones and beyond. 
A substantial number of work have seeked detectable features in disk-integrated spectra of the Earth and other planets, as they are observed from an astronomical distance. 
It has been pointed out that not only some of atmospheric molecules are identifiable through spectral absorption features \citep[e.g.,][]{DesMarais2002} but also surface reflectance spectra affect the continuum of the spectra, which could be measured through low-resolution spectra, or multi-band photometry (color) \citep[e.g.,][]{Ford2001}. 

However, interpretation of disk-integrated colors is not trivial. 
This is particularly true for Earth-like planets that harbor diverse atmospheric and surface characteristics including liquid water, partial cloud cover, continents, and possible biological surfaces, e.g. vegetation. 
Disentangling specific features from the mixed disk-integrated colors can be very challenging. 

A key here is to use time variation of the spectra; because the surface area that contributes to the scattered light changes due to the planetary spin rotation and the orbital revolution, the time variability can in principle be translated to the heterogeneity of the surface environment.  
\citet{Cowan2009, Cowan2011} performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the observed multi-band photometry of the Earth, and found that number of surface types can be inferred from the number of dominant principle components (with a difference of 1) and that the variation pattern is indicative of the surface properties. 
\citet{Fujii2010, Fujii2011} decomposed multi-band photometric data of the Earth as a linear inverse problem, assuming the template reflectance spectra of the known major surface types, and they found that the relative abundance and the longitudinal variation of these surface types are reasonably recovered. 
Moreover, by coupling the time variation due to spin rotation and that due to orbital revolution, 2-dimensional information of the surface may be retrieved with sufficient quality of data \citep{Kawahara2010, Kawahara2011, Fujii2012}. 

\citet{Cowan2013} took another approach to the same inverse problem. 
Their strategy is to try to estimate the physically meaningful reflectance spectra and their distribution across the globe simultaneously, by making all of them fitting parameters and letting them fit the data. 
The result appeared successful to the extent that the obtained reflectance spectra roughly match the typical spectra of clouds, ocean, and continents. 
However, the longitudinal map of these components do not match the reality sufficiently well. 

We were motivated by this unsatisfactory result and decided to revisit their analysis with some updates. 
Specifically, the updates include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Revisiting the formulation and point out the inherit degeneracy. 
\item Introducing regularization terms
\item Influence of the unknown radius
\end{itemize}

The organization of this paper is as follows. 
Section \ref{s:frame} revisits the problem, ....

\section{Framing the problem}
\label{s:frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Algebraic Formulation}
\label{ss:model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Assuming that the planetary surface is Lambertian scatterer everywhere, with a certain number $K$ of spectrally distinct surface types, 
the disk-integrated scattered light can be written as a weighted summation of the reflectance spectra of different surface types. 

For the moment, let us suppose that the planetary radius and the observational geometry (latitude/longitude of the sub-stellar/sub-observer points, and the distance between the star and the planet) are fully known. (This will be relaxed in \S\ref{s:discussion}.) 
In this case, we can straightforwardly translate the observed planetary intensity to albedo (or reflectivity) using the stellar flux. 
A useful normalization for albedo in exoplanet observations is {\it apparent albedo}, which is the planetary intensity normalized by that of a loss-less Lambert sphere with the same radius and at the same phase \citep{Qiu2003, Seager2010}; in this paper we will consistently use apparent albedo for our study unless otherwise noted. 

The observed apparent albedo, $d_{ij}$ (``$d$'' for data), can be written as \citep[see][]{Fujii2010}: 
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
d_{i} (\lambda_j) &=& \displaystyle \frac{ \int_{{\rm IV}_i} s_{\vec \Omega }(\lambda_j) \cdot \cos \theta_0 ({\vec \Omega}) \cdot \cos \theta_1 ({\vec \Omega}) \cdot d\vec \Omega }{ \int_{{\rm IV}_i}  \cos \theta_0 ({\vec \Omega}) \cdot \cos \theta_1 ({\vec \Omega}) \cdot d\vec \Omega } \\
&=& \sum _{k} s_k (\lambda_j) \; \displaystyle \frac{ \int_{{\rm IV}_{i}} f_k (\vec \Omega ) \cos \theta_0 ({\vec \Omega}) \cdot \cos \theta_1 ({\vec \Omega}) \cdot d\vec \Omega }{ \int_{{\rm IV}_i}  \cos \theta_0 ({\vec \Omega}) \cdot \cos \theta_1 ({\vec \Omega}) \cdot d\vec \Omega } \\
&\equiv & \sum _{i,k} f_{ik}^{\ast } \, s_{kj}
\end{eqnarray}
%%%
where $i$, $j$, and $k$ are indices for the observation epochs, bands, and the surface types, respectively, ${\rm IV }_i$ denotes the illuminated and visible area over the planetary surface at $i$-th observation, and $f (\vec \Omega )$ is the area fraction of $k$-th surface type in $d\vec \Omega$. 
In the last expression, $f_{lk}^{\ast }$ represents the contribution factor of the $k$-th surface type at $i$-th observational epoch, and 
$s_{kj}$ is the reflectance spectra of $k$-th surface type at $j$-th band. 
The maximum number of $i$, $j$ and $k$ will be denoted by $I$, $J$, and $K$, below, as summarized in Table \ref{tab:index}. 

By definition, that the area fraction $f$ and reflectance spectra $s$ are subject to the following conditions:
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{cases}
\;\; 0 < s_{kj} < 1 \;\;\; & \mbox{for any $k$, $j$} \\
\;\; 0 < f^{\ast }_{lk} < 1 \;\;\; & \mbox{for any $l$, $k$} \label{eq:cond_f_ast}\\
\;\; \sum_k f_{lk}^{\ast } = 1 & \mbox{for any $l$} 
\end{cases}
\label{eq:constraints_ast}
\end{eqnarray}
%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{table}[bh]
\caption{Indexes}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc} \hline \hline
Name & Symbol & Maximum \\ \hline
Observation Time & $i$ & I \\
Band & $j$ & J  \\
Surface Type & $k$ & K  \\
Longitudinal Slice  & $l$ & L \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:index}
\end{table}%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The time variability of the contribution factor $f^{\ast }$ due to spin rotation is related to the surface inhomogeneity along the equator. Approximately, $f^{\ast }_{ik}$ may be written as the weighted summation of the area fraction of $k$-th surface type in each of (the finite number $L$ of) longitudinal slices, i.e.,
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
f^{\ast }_{ik} &=& \frac{ \int_{{\rm IV}_{i}} f_k (\vec \Omega ) \cos \theta_0 ({\vec \Omega}) \cdot \cos \theta_1 ({\vec \Omega}) \cdot d\vec \Omega }{ \int_{{\rm IV}_i}  \cos \theta_0 ({\vec \Omega}) \cdot \cos \theta_1 ({\vec \Omega}) \cdot d\vec \Omega }  \\
&=& \sum_l \frac{ \int_{{\rm IV}_{il}}  f_k (\vec \Omega ) W (\vec \Omega  ) \cdot d\vec \Omega }{ \int_{{\rm IV}}  W (\vec \Omega ) \cdot d\vec \Omega } \\
&\sim & \sum_l f_{lk} \frac{ \int_{{\rm IV}_{il}} W (\vec \Omega ) \cdot d\vec \Omega }{ \int_{{\rm IV}}  W (\vec \Omega ) \cdot d\vec \Omega } \\
&\equiv & \sum_l  W_{il} f_{lk}
\end{eqnarray}
%%%
where $l$ is the index for longitudinal slices, $f_{lk}$ is the area fraction of the $k$-th surface type in the $l$-th longitudinal slice. 
The approximation is valid only when $f_k(\vec \Omega)$ does not change or changes little in the $l$-th slice for all $k$ and $l$. 
In the last equation, $W_{il}$ is the weight function for $i$-th epoch and $l$-th longitudinal slice which depends only on the observational geometry. 
As a result,
%%%
\begin{equation}
d_{ij} = R_p^2 \sum _{l,k} W_{il} \, f_{lk} \, s_{kj}
\end{equation}
%%%
with the following condition similar to equation (\ref{eq:cond_f_ast}):
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{cases}
\;\; 0 < s_{kj} < 1 \;\;\; & \mbox{for any $k$, $j$} \\
\;\; 0 < f_{lk} < 1 \;\;\; & \mbox{for any $l$, $k$} \\
\;\; \sum_k f_{lk} = 1 & \mbox{for any $l$} 
\end{cases}
\label{eq:constraints}
\end{eqnarray}
%%%
Now, the relevant problem is, given $d_{ij}$, estimate both $f_{lk}$ and $s_{kj}$ subject to the constraints of equation (\ref{eq:constraints})---this is where \citet{Cowan2013} stood. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Fit with $f$ or $f^{\ast}$?}
\label{ss:degeneracy}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


We argue that estimating $f$ and $s$ is no superior to estimating $f^*$ and $s$ subject to the following similar constraint:
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{cases}
\;\; 0 < s_{kj} < 1 \;\;\; & \mbox{for any $k$, $j$} \\
\;\; 0 < f^{\ast }_{lk} < 1 \;\;\; & \mbox{for any $l$, $k$} \\
\;\; \sum_k f_{lk}^{\ast } = 1 & \mbox{for any $l$} 
\end{cases}
\label{eq:constraints_ast}
\end{eqnarray}
%%%
\memoYF{write here}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Degeneracy}
\label{ss:degeneracy}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%
\begin{equation}
\tilde d_{ij} = \sum _{i,k} f_{ik}^{\ast } \, s_{kj}
\end{equation}
%%%
where $\tilde d_{ij} = d_{ij}/R_p^2$. 
Without any constraints on $f^{\ast }$ and $s$, it is trivial to notice the degeneracy in the solutions. 
Using an arbitrary regular matrix $X$ with rank $K$, a particular set of solution $\{ f^{\ast },\,s\}$ implies another set of solution $\{ f^{\ast }X^{-1},\,Xs\}$. 

Now that they are subject to the constraints (equation (\ref{eq:constraints_ast})), the range of acceptable solution is limited. 
However, the constraints cannot be sufficient to reduce them to a unique solution. 
One can create a infinite number of candidates for $f_{ik}^{\ast }$ which satisfies both of the two constraints for $f$, then $s$ may be obtained by $s = f^{+} \tilde d$, where $f^+$ is the pseudo-inverse matrix (note that $K < I$ to be able to find the solution) and among these solutions there should be many that satisfy the constraint for $s$ as well. 
\memoYF{Need to brush up. Possibly need to consider SVD of $f$. }

To see this, we demonstrate the application to the mock data with known solution in Section \ref{s:mockdata}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Bayesian Formulation}
\label{ss:regularization}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
Posterior = \prod\limits_{i,j} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }\sigma_{ij}} &&  \exp \left[ - \frac{(d_{ij} - \sum _{lk} W_{il} f_{lk} s_{kj})^2}{2 \sigma _{ij}^2} \right] \notag \\
&& \times \; \mathcal{P} (\{f_{l,k}\}) \cdot \mathcal{P}(\{s_{l,k}\}) 
\end{eqnarray}
%%%
where $\mathcal{P} (X) $ is a prior for $X$. 

In order to take account of constraints (equation (\ref{eq:constraints})), we adopt the following transformation of variables: 
%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{cases}
t_{kj} = \displaystyle \ln \left[ \frac{ s_{kj} }{1 - s_{kj} } \right]  \;\;\; & \mbox{for any $k$, $j$} \\
g_{lk} = \displaystyle \ln \left[ \frac{ f_{lk} }{1 - \sum _{m=0}^{k} f_{lm} } \right] \;\;\; & \mbox{for $k=1, ..., K-1$, any $j$} 
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}
%%%
Note that there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between $t$ and $s$ or $g$ and $f$ where $s$ and $f$ always satisfy our constraints.

\subsection{Creating Mock Data}
\label{ss:createmockdata}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Before applying to the observed data, we shall demonstrate the analysis procedure with a mock dataset with the known answer. 
For this purpose, we use a simplified albedo map of the Earth based on the IGBP classification. 
We re-classify the IGBP map into four surface types, ``ocean', ``vegetation', and ``soil'' and following Table 2 of \citet{Fujii2010} except that we merge ``snow'' into ``soil'' considering its small fraction. 
The upper left panel of Figure \ref{fig:mockdata} depicts such an surface classification. 
The reflectance spectra for these three surface types ($s_{kj}$) are adopted from ASTER spectral library \citep{Baldridge2009} in the same way as \citet{Fujii2010} (Figure 7 in that paper), and are shown in the upper right panel of Figure \ref{fig:mockdata}. 

We then compute the geometrically weighted area fraction of each surface type (``contribution factor'' or $f^{\ast }_{ik}$) assuming an equatorial view at the quadrature \memoYF{Describe in more detail.}; this is shown in the lower left panel of Figure \ref{fig:mockdata}. 
Using $s_{kj}$ and $f^{\ast }_{ik}$, we compute the apparent albedo at each observation frame, on the assumption that the surfaces are ``Lambert'' scatterers. The effect of atmosphere is completely ignored. 
The mock lightcurves created through the above-mentioned procedure is presented in the lower right panel of Figure \ref{fig:mockdata}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We now apply our framework to the observed multi-band reflected light curves of the Earth obtained with EPOXI \citep{Livengood2011, Cowan2011}. 
There are 7 photometric filters from about 300 nm to 1000 nm, each of which has roughly 100-nm band width. 
In total, 5 series of observations were conducted, each of which spans $\sim $24 hours with 1-hour intervals. 
Since one of them includes lunar transit in front of the Earth and the interpretation is not straightforward, we just remove it from our data and consider only 4 series of observations, which were conducted on March 2008, June 2008, March 2009, and October 2009. 
The data are presented in Figure \ref{fig:EPOXIlc} in terms of {\it apparent albedo}. 

The geometrical configuration among the star, the target (the Earth), and the detector varies from observation to observation. 
The information is summarized in \citet{Cowan2011}, but we also outline in Table \ref{tab:EPOXI} just for reference.
